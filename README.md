# rotten-potatoes-api

A movies REST API built with HTTP protocol, Node.js, NPM, SQLite, and Typescript.

To get started: `npm run start`

Running that command will trigger the execution in order of the scripts:

1. prebuild
2. build
3. prestart
4. start

which will build our project inside the “dist” folder, and run it only if everything was ok.
